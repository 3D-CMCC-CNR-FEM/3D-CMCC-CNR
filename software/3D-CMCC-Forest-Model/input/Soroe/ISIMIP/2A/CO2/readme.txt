Files reporting the concentration of CO2 (ppm) per year consistent to RCP assumptions.
Datasets start on:
1901 (only historical) as it is the oldest starting year for reanalysis-based climate datasets
1950 (both historical and RCP) as starting point of GCM simulations

N.B. because of choices for ISI-MIP CO2 dataset to be still clarified, all 2006 to 2013 years are taken 
from RCP8.5 also in case of other RCPs. From 2014 onwards, CO2 is consistent across RCPs.
