# Under Linux/MacOS You can build and run this project using autotools instead of Code::Blocks or Eclipse IDE Platforms

- be shure to have installed autoconf, automake and libtool packages
- go into top level project directory
- type the following to obtain a configure file:
autoreconf -i
- launch configure to obtain make files:
./configure
- type "make" to build the project: the executable and object files will be put inside src directory:
make

# make utilities:
- to clean the project by obj files, scripts and executables (not the one produced with autoreconf -i):
make clean
- to launch unit test, to check if the executable produced is working or not:
make check
- to create a distribution package:
make dist

# Notes:
- When you run "autoreconf -i", a lot of files and dirs are produced.
Do not get worried: the build system needs them, but you do not have to care about them.
They are set not to be considered by subversion: you can delete and recreate them with "autoreconf -i".
The only autotools files versioned that you do not have to delete are:
-- configure.ac
-- Makefile.am
-- src/Makefile.am
To be shure what is versioned or not (if not you can delete it), go into a directory and type:
svn list
