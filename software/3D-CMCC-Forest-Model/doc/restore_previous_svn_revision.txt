# How to restore a previous svn revision as the latest one
# For example from 564 to 560: the latest commit will create revision 566 which is identical to 560
- open a terminal
- go to the parent directory of the folder you want to restore:
  cd ~/Scrivania/forSE/software
- export the revision you want to restore:
  svn export -r 560 3D-CMCC-Forest-Model ~/Scrivania/3D-CMCC-Forest-Model
- remove the directory current updated to rev 564
  svn del 3D-CMCC-Forest-Model
- commit this change obtaining revision 565
  svn commit -m "Temporary deletion of 3D-CMCC-Forest-Model: restoring of previous revision process"
- move directory exported before, in the same place
  mv ~/Scrivania/3D-CMCC-Forest-Model .
- add it to the repository
  svn add 3D-CMCC-Forest-Model
- commit this change:
  svn commit -m "Restore complete: now revision 566 of 3D-CMCC-Forest-Model is the same as 560"
