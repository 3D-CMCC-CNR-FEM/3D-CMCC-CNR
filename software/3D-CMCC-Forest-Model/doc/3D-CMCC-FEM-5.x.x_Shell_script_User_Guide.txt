General notes on 3D-CMCC-CNR-FEM Bash Script tool,
3D-CMCC-CNR Forest Ecosystem Model (FEM) is a software bash tool to help user to run 3D-CMCC-CNR C code that simulates
the storage and fluxes of water, carbon and energy, within the vegetation, litter, and soil components of a forest ecosystem. 
3D-CMCC-CNR-FEM is primarily a research tool, and many versions have been developed for particular purposes. 
The CMCC, CNR and the University of Tuscia (Viterbo) maintain benchmark code versions for
public release, and update these benchmark versions periodically as new knowledge is gained on the research front.
The bash script and the model executables accompanying this file represent the most recent benchmark version.

IMPORTANT NOTE: COPYING
The 3D-CMCC-CNR-FEM Basch script and Model C code, Version x.x.x code are both copyrighted. 
You may not make copies of any part of the code for distribution to
any other person or group. However, anyone can get a free copy of the code from Alessio Collalti (alessio.collalti@cmcc.it).
The purpose for this restriction is to keep track of who has a specific version of the public release benchmark code, so that
we can let our user community know when there are updates. We will appreciate your cooperation with this policy.
Referencing 3D-CMCC-FEM:
If you use 3D-CMCC-CNR-FEM in your research, we request that you include the following acknowledgement in the relevant
manuscripts:

If you have made any significant modifications to the code, please mention them in your manuscript.
This User’s Guide is the only documentation released with 3D-CMCC-FEM. The code itself contains extensive internal
documentation, and users with specific questions about the algorithms used to estimate particular processes should read
the comments in the appropriate source code files. The file treemodel.c contains references to all the core science routines,
and is a good starting point for this kind of inquiry. The files matrix.c defines the data structures that are used to
pass information between the process modules, and includes both a short text description and the units for each internal
variable. If you have questions about the code, appropriate model applications, possible programming errors, etc.,
please read this entire guide first, then feel free to contact:

The 3D-CMCC-CNR-FEM Basch script is intended to help users to run model C code answering to a series of stdin quesions about
simulations you want to do or if you want simulate a site not included in site list at first of all make sure to create 
mandatory files to run model.

3D-CMCC-CNR-FEM model is a primarly a stand scale model, script logs a list of possible sites where run the model 
(if data are enough) or it is allowed to include other sites in this way:
 
 [1] create site folder in /input/ "site name"
 
 >within /input/site_name you need to create:
 
 *****************************************************************************************************************************
 [a] create in: /input/"stand" folder
 
 -STAND INPUT DATA that refers to forest stand data at initial condition (see model user's guide)
  signature of stand file needs to be in this way:
  
  FILE NAME: "sitename"_"stand"_"year at which stand status refers" (e.g. Soroe_stand_2003.txt)
 
 *****************************************************************************************************************************
 [b] create in: /input/"meteo" folder

 -METEO INPUT DATA: that refers to meteo dataset used in simulation (the first year is the year in which model srats to simulate
  so be carefull that stand data matches with meteo data". For data to be included in and units see model user's guide
  
  FILE NAME: "sitename"_"meteo"_"first_year"_"last_year" (e.g. Soroe_meteo_2003_2014.txt)
  
 *****************************************************************************************************************************
 [a] put in: /input/"stand" folder
  
 -SOIL INPUT DATA: that refers to stand soil datased used in simulation
 
  FILE NAME: "sitename"_"soil" (e.g. Soroe_soil.txt)
 
 *****************************************************************************************************************************
 [a] put in: /input/"stand" folder
 
 -TOPO INPUT DATA: that refers to stand topographic datased used in simulation
 
  FILE NAME: "sitename"_"topo" (e.g. Soroe_topo.txt)
  
 *****************************************************************************************************************************
  
 -MODEL SETTINGS: that refers to model settings used in simulation
 
  FILE NAME: "sitename"_"settings" (e.g. Soroe_topo.txt)
