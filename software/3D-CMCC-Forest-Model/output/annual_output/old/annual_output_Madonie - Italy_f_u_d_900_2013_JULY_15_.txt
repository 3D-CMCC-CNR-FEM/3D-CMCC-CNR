Annual GPP = annual total gross primary production (gC/m2/year)
Annual NPP = annual total net primary production (tDM/m2/year)
Annual ET = annual canopy transpiration(mm/year)
Annual AGB = annual above-ground biomass(tDM/area/year)
Annual BGB = annual below-ground biomass(tDM/area/year)
Annual PEAK_LAI = annual Peak Lai (m^2/m^2)
